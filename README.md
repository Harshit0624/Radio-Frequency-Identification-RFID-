# Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)
Overview
This project is a demonstration of a Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) system, which enables automatic identification of objects using radio waves. The goal of this project is to provide a simple and functional implementation of RFID-based identification, usable in applications like attendance systems, access control, inventory tracking, and more.

The system consists of an RFID reader module (such as the MFRC522), RFID tags/cards, and a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino). When a tag is brought near the reader, the system reads its unique identifier (UID) and processes it accordingly — for example, by logging it or triggering access permissions.

What is RFID?
RFID is a wireless communication technology that uses electromagnetic fields to identify and track tags attached to objects. An RFID system generally consists of:

Reader: The device that emits radio signals and receives data from the tag.
Tag: A small device that contains a microchip and antenna. Each tag has a unique identifier.
Controller: A microcontroller or computer that processes data from the reader.
This technology is used widely in logistics, asset tracking, contactless payments, smart cards, and more.

Project Features
Detects RFID tags/cards in real-time
Reads and displays UID from each tag
Can be used as the base for access control or attendance systems
Supports integration with databases or logs
Simple, modular, and well-commented code for easy customization
Hardware Required
RFID Reader (e.g., MFRC522)
RFID tags or cards (13.56 MHz)
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino UNO, ESP32, STM32, etc.)
Jumper wires
Breadboard or soldered connections
Power supply (USB or battery)
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE (if using Arduino)
MFRC522 Library (for RC522 module)
Serial Monitor (built into IDE) or external display (optional)
Getting Started
Clone or download this repository.
Connect the RFID module to the microcontroller.
Open the provided source code in your development environment (e.g., rfid_reader.ino for Arduino).
Upload the code to your microcontroller.
Open the serial monitor and scan a tag to see the UID printed in real-time.
Example Use Cases
Door access system: Allow/deny entry based on tag UID
School attendance: Log students’ presence via RFID cards
Smart library: Automatically register borrowed books
Office login system: Track employee check-in/out times
